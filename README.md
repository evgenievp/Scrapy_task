Hello everyone,

I am Petar Evtimov, and this is my attempt to solve the Scrapy task as part of my application for the Junior Python Developer position.
The goal of this task was to extract product details from a webpage using the Scrapy framework. This project helped me improve my understanding of web scraping, especially working with CSS selectors and handling structured data.

Approach & Learning Process
Scrapy Documentation: I referred to the official Scrapy documentation to understand the framework’s structure.
CSS Selectors: I used resources like GeeksforGeeks to deepen my understanding of CSS selectors.
XPath: I faced challenges with XPath and couldn’t fully implement it, but I plan to continue learning.

Progress & Achievements
Extracted product name correctly
Identified price, though still improving the extraction
Had difficulties extracting color and other attributes

Even though the solution is not complete, I gained valuable experience and insight into Scrapy, which will help me improve in future tasks.

Future Improvements
Learn and practice XPath for better element selection.
Improve data extraction for attributes like color and reviews.
Explore handling dynamically loaded content (JavaScript-based elements) in Scrapy.

This was a great learning experience, and I look forward to improving my Scrapy skills further. Thank you for reviewing my solution!
Best regards,
Petar Evtimov
